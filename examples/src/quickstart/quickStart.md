Below is a quick start example only using fields.

This example nicely shows my preferred way of using model-react, by creating a data model using classes.
Components can then take an instance of a data model as a property, and cleanly visualize and or update aspects of that model.

More examples of specific model-react components and aspects can be found under [examples](#examples), as well as potential use case examples under [advanced examples](#advanced_examples).
An overview of model-react including the API can be found in the main readme on [Github.com/TarVK/model-react](https://github.com/TarVK/model-react).
